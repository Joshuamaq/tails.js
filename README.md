## Getting Started

To get started with Tails.js, simply include the following script tag in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tails.js"></script>
```

This will load the framework and make all utility classes available for use.

## Usage

Tails.js allows you to apply utility classes directly in your HTML. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded">
  Hello, Tails.js!
</div>
```

In this example, the classes `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `p-4`, and `rounded` apply background color, text color, padding, and border radius, respectively.

## Customization

You can customize Tails.js to fit your needs. The framework provides a range of utility classes that you can mix and match. If you need to create your own utility classes, you can do so by adding your CSS styles in a separate stylesheet.

### Example Custom Class

```css
.custom-class {
  background-color: #ff6347; /* Tomato */
  color: white;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

You can then use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div class="custom-class">
  Custom Styled Element
</div>
```

## Themes

Tails.js comes with several built-in themes. You can switch between them easily by adding a class to your HTML element. For example:

```html
<div class="theme-dark">
  Dark Theme Content
</div>
```

### Adding Custom Themes

To create a custom theme, define your styles in a CSS file and include it in your project. Then, apply the custom theme class to your elements.

## Responsive Design

Responsive design is straightforward with Tails.js. The framework provides responsive utility classes that allow you to control the layout at different breakpoints.

### Example Responsive Classes

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-green-500">
  Responsive Background Color
</div>
```

In this example, the background color changes based on the screen size.

## Plugins

Tails.js supports a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality. You can create your own plugins or use existing ones from the community.

### Creating a Plugin

To create a plugin, define a JavaScript function that adds new utility classes or modifies existing ones. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
function myPlugin() {
  // Add new utility classes
}
```

You can then include this plugin in your project.
